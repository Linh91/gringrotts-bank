#Gringrotts Bank

The only bank of the wizarding world.

As a wizard\n
So I can put money into my account to buy an owl\n
I would like to credit an amount into my account\n

As a wizard\n
So I can buy myself a butterbeer\n
I would like to withdraw an amount from my account\n

As a wizard\n
So I can check how much I have in my bank incase Voldermolt rises\n
I would like to check the activities of my account\n
